# HAM10000-Research-Study

This project was a Capstone Anatomy and Physiology research project in which
students of the class had to make a mock research paper. 

Model Omega described in the paper is Model-002

The research paper is included in this repository alongside the logs during training. The model checkpoints weren't saved due to their massive size.
